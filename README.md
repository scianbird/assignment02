Welcome to my 3rd version of this (・-・)
the other 2 versions are LEARNING and EXPERIENCE. and that's WORTH IT.

The aim for this website is to create a responsive image gallery that displays thumbnails and, when clicked, a fullscreen image.

I wanted to style it something like an online scrapbook (to slightly offset the fact I could not style the portrait images how I wanted) but didn't want a very high-quality image for the background on every occassion, so I read this: https://dev.to/ingosteinke/responsive-background-images-with-image-set-the-srcset-for-background-image-259a
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus

I am upset at myself for not managing to insert elements into the DOM via the array index. While the index is counting up when you click the "next" button, I can't quite figure out the correct scope of where the variables/functions should be declared but I am taking this "failure" on the chin and instead focusing on the fact that I will be able to return to this project in the future (hopefully in the near future) and include all the features I wanted to add (I have left them in, but commented out)

During the class group time, Ryan, Elena and myself worked on displaying the thumbnail images inline as well as setting the scroll to be horizontal rather than vertical. The collaboration helped me here, as Elena caught that my images were not displaying due to the wrong shape of brackets I had used in my code (curse you, [ !) but thankfully all our issues were solved by the time the breakout session was complete.

When I (finally) got the images to display full-screen but not full size, I realised the problem that different image orientation presents, and after a conversation with Gary, we decided that "fullscreen" hopefully meant that the whole image was on screen, not that the full screen was an image. Let's hope that was the correct understanding.

I think the emotions as I finally admit defeat on this project are disappointment in myself, but not without a glimmer of hope and acknowledgement that I can at least think my way through the problems (which would have seemed impossible at the start of last week). Time to practice this assignment in my self-reflection time next week!
